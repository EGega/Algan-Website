        <h2>INTERMODAL (FCL & LCL)</h2>
        <p>Intermodal Transportation is the method, where at least two diverse transportation modes are utilized without replacing the container. Being the most brand new innovator  intermodal transportation company in Turkey, we ensure  our customers decrease their costs and  offer the most economical and environment-friendly solution through optimum transit periods.

 

          <br> The basic combinations we use are as follows;
          
           
          
              <br>   <strong>Road + RO-RO + Rail</strong> 
          
               <br>    <strong>Road + Rail</strong>
          
                  
          
        <br>  The model to be used is determined mainly in terms of the following: final destination of the load, urgency, seasonal and economical factors.
          
           
          
         <br> <strong>FOR EXAMPLE:</strong> 
          Road transportation from Istanbul to Amsterdam , distance is almost 270 kms. Intermodal method for the same route, descreases road for only 150 kms. As a result of this, fossil fuel consumption as well as carbon emissions are reduced.

        <p>Project loads also known as “ Out of Gauge” , are distinguished from other loads by their volume and weight. The transportation of these loads, which are extremely high, wide and heavy, is a special area of expertise. It also requires many special methods, tools and equipment.

Furthermore, it is not affected by the transfer of the load to a different vehicle, delays in landing and take-off of the aeroplanes and the difficulties caused by the lack of airports everywhere.
